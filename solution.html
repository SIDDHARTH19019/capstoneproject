								<h2>What is ragging?</h2>
							</header>
							<p class="ragging">       Ragging is the term used for the so-called "initiation ritual" <br />
								practiced in higher education institutions in South Asian <br />
								countries, including Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. <br />
								The practise is similar to hazing in North America, <br />
								bizutage in France, praxe in Portugal, and other similar <br />
								practices in educational institutions across the world. <br />
								<br />
								Ragging involves abuse, humiliation, or harassment <br />
								of new entrants or junior students by the senior students.
								<br />
								It often takes a malignant form wherein the newcomers <br />
								may be subjected to psychological or physical torture. <br />
								In 2009, the University Grants Commission of India imposed <br />
								regulations upon Indian universities to help curb ragging <br />
								and launched a toll-free 'anti-ragging helpline'.</p>

						   <li>
							 Employ a counselor Many a times, students are not able to reveal their
							 ordeal to their parents. However, they can open up about their
							 sufferings to a counseling cell. The cell can also motivate students
							 to be empathetic towards juniors and newcomers.
						   </li>
						   <br>
						   <li>
							 Usage of CCTV footage Each and every corner of the college must be
							 under surveillance in order to keep a check on violent activities on
							 the campus. When a senior knows that he is being captured on CCTV
							 footage, it makes it difficult for him to rag a junior.
						   </li>
						   <br>
						   <li>
							 Interactions between seniors and juniors <br />
							 Promoting healthy interactions between seniors and juniors can create
							 a positive environment. College can host various activities which help
							 college students to break the ice.
						   </li>
						   <br>
						   <li>
							 Punishments Ragging happens when the culprit knows he cannot be
							 touched. Until or unless the Anti-Ragging law is strictly imposed,
							 such cases will keep on coming to the front.
						   </li>
						   <br>
						   <li>
							 Anti-Ragging Squad in campus A team of students, as well as teachers,
							 can be formed in the college to fight the evil of ragging. The team
							 should be representative in nature consisting of students from all
							 backgrounds, grades, years, genders.

									<h2>How to stop ragging as a student?</h2>
								</header>
								<p class="ragging">The problem of ragging is not something you can overcome or wish for it to end, <br>
									ragging involves abuse and harassment and it's a punishable offence and should be reported, <br>
									suffering in silence is not going to make things right, infact it might make it worse. <br>
									You can educate yourself about the university rules about ragging, <br>
									 most universities have anti ragging posters with contact numbers on them, <br>
									  save those numbers for when you're in the difficult position again. <br>
									Have support of your friends and discuss about your problems, <br>
									 and if you have elder cousins or friends who are may have had the same experiences, <br>
									  talk to them and know how they dealt with it. <br>
									Also there are many possibilities and stories behind your question, <br>
									 I hope things get better and you get help in putting a stop to ragging.
